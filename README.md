## Course Description
Designed for students who have wondered about inner workings of Roomba, selfie drone, or self-driving car, and how they have become so much better over past few years; and those interested in creating next generation of autonomous robots. Survey of state-of-the-art in computation for robotics, including both classical and machine learning approaches to state estimation, control, planning, and design. Topics may include Bayesian filtering, reinforcement learning, localization and mapping, Markov decision processes, planning with search and probabilistic roadmaps, evolutionary design, and human-robot interaction. Includes substantial final project; particularly strong ones may lead to funded research opportunities. Students should be comfortable with mathematical reasoning, probability, linear algebra, multivariable calculus, and programming.
